# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Concluded "Responsive Web Design Certification" > "Basic HTML and HTML5" > "Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5"

**Thoughts:** This part was really simple. I struggled in one of the exercises as I did not realize that I was supposed to have the two input fields inside separate label tags. This part was simple and easy. CSS next.

### Day 2: April 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working through "Responsive Web Design Certification" > "Basic HTML and HTML5" > "Working through Basic CSS"

**Thoughts**: CSS attributes and classes are easy to use and apply to HTML. Learned about classes and how to change attributes to elements. Font-style, font-family, background-color and others. Also worked with id's and how to apply styling through CSS.

### Day 3: April 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Concluded "Working through Basic CSS". It interesting to understand the priorities around styling elements including inline style declarations and !important. Worked through colors HEX and RGB, CSS variables and fallback values and had one lesson on media queries.

**Thoughts**: The concepts are simple so far and clearly lay the foundations for some more complex topics. Happy to continue!

### Day 4: April 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started "Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges". Interesting to learn align, underline, bold and strikeout  text as well as to create a box shadow.

**Thoughts**: The box shadow is a bit more complex to understand as it requires offset (both x and y axis) and the blur and spread radius for shadowing as well as the colour. Tried moving around the offset-x and offset-y and didn't seem to do anything which was surprising, meaning I don't really follow what it does so I'll keep it at zero. :)

### Day 5: April 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still working through "Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges". Learned many new things and concepts such as opacity, text-transform, font-size/weight, line-height, hover state, pseudo classes, relative and absolute positioning, float.

**Thoughts**: There's a lot of stuff to remember... The relative and absolute positioning are the most complex concepts even though it is clear that an element with absolute positioning is only absolute in relation to its parent, which should have position: relative... I thought that if I wrote it it would make more sense but not really. :)

### Day 6: April 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still working through "Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges". Learned many new things and concepts such as positioning, float, differences between inline and block elements & started color theory.

**Thoughts**: Positioning with float is a bit awkward but I know it exists. Need to see more practical examples of this. Color theory with RGB, Hex and actual color names. Not sure when to use RGB instead of HEX for example. But moving on :)

### Day 7: April 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still working through "Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges". Today I learned how to adjust the hue and tone of a color, as well as to create a gradual CSS Llinear gradient. Ah and that expressions need to end with ";" or they give you errors that don't point you in the right direction to fix it. *duh*

**Thoughts**:

### Day 8: April 25th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished with the "Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges". Creating graphics in CSS with the ::before and ::after. CSS Animation and @keyframes properties were quite interesting to learn as well as variable rates and bezier curves.  

**Thoughts**: The graphics part with the ::before and ::after was quite surprising. Wasn't aware you could do a lot of these things with CSS and thought this would be JavaScript or some other way to create animations. The number is keywords is getting staggering and honestly can't remeber all in an instant. Knowing the concepts is great but I will more than likely have to refer to somewhere when I'll start from scratch.

### Day 9: April 27th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started with "Applied Accessibility". Understanding the relationship between accessibility and certain tags is very important. Learned about the use of ALT and other tags such as <header> <audio> <footer> <nav> <article> <section> <main>. Interesting how <header> <footer> <nav> <article> <section> are in all effects a <div> but the difference is really due to accessibility and how screen readers use these specific tags to aid people that are visually impared.

**Thoughts**: It's really important to design for accessibility to ensure that people that cannot read can still benefit from the information a website.

### Day 10: April 29th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Applied Accessibility". Interesting how using CSS to position text away from the screen visibility to allow screen readers to read it. Never thought about it. While I understood the concept, I honestly didn't understand how it then works, or how does the scrfeen reader reads a table, for example, but I hope there will some more about it ahead, or I will have to find more information as I won't be able to implement it. 

**Thoughts**: What I learned from this module is that accessibility is probably a subject on its own. I realized I don't really understand the challenges faced by visually impaired persons or what the technology does and what it can do to assist people. While I know its an issue, never REALLY thought about. #FeelingGuilty

### Day 11: May 1st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Responsive Web Design Challenges. The viewport concept is definitely interesting, more so due to mobile devices. Also understood something about image responsiveness that I had a question on. Learned vh, vw, vmin and vmax as options to em and px. Learned media queries and image responsiveness as well as "retina images".

**Thoughts**: Short module but key concepts. Interesting p+oint on image responsiveness that regardless of "width: 100%" the image does not go over it's max width, an issue I faced before and couldn't figure out.

### Day 12: May 2nd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the "Introduction to the CSS Flexbox Challenges" - Flexbox seems to be a really powerful way to organize content. In reality you're still using <div> but with CSS you justify, align and manage positioning and spacing of elements within rows/col.

**Thoughts**: Honestly there was a lot of content. Hope I can at least remember that there was a lot of options to justify and align and that I can search for it as I will definitely not remember it all...

### Day 13: May 3rd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the "Introduction to the CSS Grid Challenges". It was probably my favourite module so far. The power of grids combined with media queries for example seems great. There are too many options to remember them all but I will fall back to the examples to remember the options. 

**Thoughts**: Really motivated to complete the Responsive Web Design Certification. Moving on to the Responsive Web Design Projects next!
