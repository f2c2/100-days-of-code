# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Concluded "Responsive Web Design Certification" > "Basic HTML and HTML5" > "Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5"

**Thoughts:** This part was really simple. I struggled in one of the exercises as I did not realize that I was supposed to have the two input fields inside separate label tags. This part was simple and easy. CSS next.

**Today's Progress**: Working through "Responsive Web Design Certification" > "Basic HTML and HTML5" > "Working through Basic CSS"

**Thoughts**: CSS attributes and classes are easy to use and apply to HTML. Learned about classes and how to change attributes to elements. Font-style, font-family, background-color and others. Also worked with id's and how to apply styling through CSS.
