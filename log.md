# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Concluded "Responsive Web Design Certification" > "Basic HTML and HTML5" > "Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5"

**Thoughts:** This part was really simple. I struggled in one of the exercises as I did not realize that I was supposed to have the two input fields inside separate label tags. This part was simple and easy. CSS next.

### Day 2: April 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working through "Responsive Web Design Certification" > "Basic HTML and HTML5" > "Working through Basic CSS"

**Thoughts**: CSS attributes and classes are easy to use and apply to HTML. Learned about classes and how to change attributes to elements. Font-style, font-family, background-color and others. Also worked with id's and how to apply styling through CSS.

### Day 3: April 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Concluded "Working through Basic CSS". It interesting to understand the priorities around styling elements including inline style declarations and !important. Worked through colors HEX and RGB, CSS variables and fallback values and had one lesson on media queries.

**Thoughts**: The concepts are simple so far and clearly lay the foundations for some more complex topics. Happy to continue!

### Day 4: April 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started "Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges". Interesting to learn align, underline, bold and strikeout  text as well as to create a box shadow.

**Thoughts**: The box shadow is a bit more complex to understand as it requires offset (both x and y axis) and the blur and spread radius for shadowing as well as the colour. Tried moving around the offset-x and offset-y and didn't seem to do anything which was surprising, meaning I don't really follow what it does so I'll keep it at zero. :)

### Day 5: April 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still working through "Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges". Learned many new things and concepts such as opacity, text-transform, font-size/weight, line-height, hover state, pseudo classes, relative and absolute positioning, float.

**Thoughts**: There's a lot of stuff to remember... The relative and absolute positioning are the most complex concepts even though it is clear that an element with absolute positioning is only absolute in relation to its parent, which should have position: relative... I thought that if I wrote it it would make more sense but not really. :)

### Day 6: April 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still working through "Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges". Learned many new things and concepts such as positioning, float, differences between inline and block elements & started color theory.

**Thoughts**: Positioning with float is a bit awkward but I know it exists. Need to see more practical examples of this. Color theory with RGB, Hex and actual color names. Not sure when to use RGB instead of HEX for example. But moving on :)

### Day 7: April 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still working through "Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges". Today I learned how to adjust the hue and tone of a color, as well as to create a gradual CSS Llinear gradient. Ah and that expressions need to end with ";" or they give you errors that don't point you in the right direction to fix it. *duh*
